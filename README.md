# Customers-Database-of-Broadcom-Tech-Company
The program reads from a file and fills both a Hash Table and a Binary Search Tree (BST) with Customer objects, using unique Customer Numbers and Names, which can have duplicates.
Primary keys are hashed to provide an index in the Hash Table. The Customer objects are held in Nodes which are then placed into Linked Lists at the index in the hash table.
Customer objects are inserted into the BST by sorting the name string. The program then displays a list of commands and allows users to choose how they want to edit the data 
structure or to print the data.
